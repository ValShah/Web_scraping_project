  ,Background:, Elranatamab (PF-06863135) is a humanized bispecific monoclonal antibody (IgG2a) that targets BCMA, a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily expressed in MM, and CD3 on T cells. We reported results for intravenous (IV) dosing (Raje et al. Blood. 2019;134(S1):1869) and now update for subcutaneous (SC) dosing from the ongoing Phase 1 study (MagnetisMM-1). ,Methods:, Patients (pts) received elranatamab at 80, 130, 215, 360, 600, and 1000μg/kg SC weekly. A modified toxicity probability interval method was used for escalation, with monitoring for dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) to end of the first cycle. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were graded by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (v4.03), and cytokine release syndrome (CRS) by American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy criteria (Lee et al. Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2019;25:625). Response was assessed by International Myeloma Working Group criteria. Pharmacokinetics, cytokine profiling, and T cell immunophenotyping were performed. ,Results:, 30 pts had received elranatamab as of 4-Aug-2020 at 80 (n = 6), 130 (n = 4), 215 (n = 4), 360 (n = 4), 600 (n = 6), or 1000 (n = 6) μg/kg SC weekly. Pts had a median of 8 prior treatments; 87% had triple refractory disease, 97% had prior anti-CD38 therapy, and 23% had prior BCMA-directed antibody drug conjugate or chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy. The most common all causality TEAEs included lymphopenia (n = 24, 80%; 20% G3, 60% G4), CRS (n = 22, 73%; none > G2), anemia (n = 17, 57%; 43% G3, 3% G4), injection site reaction (n = 16, 53%; none > G2), thrombocytopenia (n = 16, 53%; 23% G3, 17% G4), and neutropenia (n = 12, 40%; 17% G3, 17% G4). Both CRS and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (n = 6, 20%) were limited to ≤G2 with median durations of 2 and 1.5 days, respectively. No DLT was observed. Exposure increased with dose, and T,max, ranged from 3–7 days. Cytokine increases occurred with the first dose, and increased T-cell proliferation was observed in peripheral blood. The overall response rate (ORR) for doses ≥215μg/kg was 75% (n = 15/20) including partial response (PR; n = 6), very good PR (VGPR; n = 3), complete response (CR; n = 1), and stringent CR (sCR; n = 5). Median time to response was 22 days, and 3 of 4 pts (75%) with prior BCMA-directed therapy achieved response (VGPR, n = 2 and sCR, n = 1). Updated data, including duration of response, will be presented. ,Conclusions:, Elranatamab demonstrated a manageable safety profile, and SC doses ≥215μg/kg achieved ORR of 75% with CR/sCR rate of 30%. These results demonstrate the safety and efficacy of SC elranatamab in this relapsed/refractory population and support ongoing development of elranatamab for pts with MM, both as monotherapy and in combination with standard or novel therapies.

  ,Background:, Metastatic RCC (mRCC) involving the pancreas is distinct from RCC involving other metastatic sites and is characterized by an indolent clinical course, heightened angiogenesis, and an inflamed stroma (PMID: 32271170). We previously reported on outcomes of RCC patients (pts) with pancreatic oligometastasis (ASCO GU 2020). We now report on outcomes in pts with mRCC involving the pancreas in conjunction with other metastases (mets). ,Methods:, We conducted a retrospective, multi-institutional study of mRCC pts with mets to the pancreas and other sites. Data on pt demographics, tumor characteristics, systemic therapy, and outcomes were collected. Pts were classified based on treatment category: immunotherapy (IO) or vascular endothelial growth factor/receptor inhibitors (VEGFI). Outcomes measured included objective response rates (ORR), time-on-treatment (TOT), and overall survival (OS). ,Results:, The analysis included 229 pts from 9 institutions, diagnosed between 1985-2020. Of these, 211 (92%) had clear-cell histology; 131 (57%) had nephrectomy; 41 (18%) had local pancreas-directed therapy; 111 (48%) had synchronous presentation of disease in the pancreas and other sites at time of mets. IMDC risk was favorable in 33%, intermediate in 41%, poor in 11%, and unknown in 15% pts. Median lines of therapy was 2 (range 0-9). Of 219 pts who received first-line (1L) therapy, 151 (69%) had VEGFI therapy, 41 (19%) had IO, and 18 (8%) had VEGFI/IO combination (Table). The IO group included 21 pts on checkpoint inhibitor (CPI), 16 pts on HD-IL2, 4 pts on other IO. 1L ORR was 39.7% for VEGFI (95% CI 31.8-48.0) and 31.7% for IO (95% CI 18.1-48.1) and was not statistically significant (NS, OR 1.4, 95% CI 0.65-3.23, p = 0.371). Median TOT for 1L therapy was 11.6m for VEGFI and 6.5m for IO (p = 0.0106). With a median follow-up of 51.5m, the median OS (mOS) for all pts from time of metastatic disease was 7.7 years (y) (95% CI 6.3-10.3). The mOS for pts who received 1L VEGFI was 7.6y (95% CI 5.5-9.5) and was not reached (NR) for those who got 1L IO (95%CI 6.5-NR); this difference was significant with an unadjusted p-value of 0.029. The pair-wise comparison between mOS of the 1L CPI subgroup compared to that of the 1L VEGFI group was significant (p = 0.0148). ,Conclusions:, Consistent with the literature, mRCC pts with involvement of the pancreas in this study have prolonged OS compared to historical OS for the standard mRCC population. Additionally, our findings suggest that the choice of first-line therapy may impact outcomes. Additional analyses will be presented.,First-Line therapy.","Cassandra Duarte, Benoit Beuselinck, Nicole Weise, Nazli Dizman, Katharine Collier, Haoran Li, Nieves Martinez Chanza, Roy Elias, Tracy L Rose, James Brugarolas, Neeraj Agarwal, Amir Mortazavi, Sumanta K.

  ,Background:, Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has revolutionized patient outcome for the small mCRC subgroup with highly immunogenic disease. The majority of mCRC cases, however, are MSS without innate ICB susceptibility. In our ongoing METIMMOX study, we hypothesize that MSS mCRC can be transformed into an immunogenic condition by short-course oxaliplatin-based therapy (FLOX), enabling patients with unresectable, previously untreated metastases to obtain durable disease control when adding ICB therapy. Here we present the protocol-planned interim analysis. ,Methods:, Eligibility criteria include infradiaphragmatic metastasis and C-reactive protein < 60 mg/L. At analysis 15 January 2021, 54 patients stratified according to primary tumor sidedness and mutational status and evaluable for the primary end point (progression-free survival; PFS) had been randomly assigned to a standard-of-care schedule of 8 FLOX cycles Q2W (control arm) or repeat sequential 2 FLOX cycles and 2 nivolumab cycles (240 mg Q2W) to a total of 8 cycles (experimental arm), for both arms before treatment break until disease progression and reintroduction of a new treatment sequence. Radiologic response assessment is every 8 weeks. Safety, tolerability, objective response rate, and duration of response are among secondary end points. ,Results:, At median follow-up of 6.4 (range, 0.5-20) months, patients were well balanced between the treatment arms with regard to the predefined strata and single-organ or multiple-organ metastases. Median PFS for the entire groups of control and experimental arm patients was 5.6 (range, 0.5-15; ,n, = 26) and 6.6 (range, 0.5-20; ,n, = 28) months, respectively. The number of FLOX-related CTCAE grade 3 or higher adverse events, including 2 deaths after initial FLOX administration, was comparable in the two arms. Twelve immune-related grade 3-4 adverse events (no new safety signals) were recorded. In the experimental arm, 4 (16%) patients, all ,RAS/BRAF,-mutant cases, had experienced complete response and 9 (32%) patients had ongoing objective response at 8 months. The control arm cases had 0 with complete response and 6 (23%) with ongoing objective response at 8 months, 1 of whom had proceeded to curative-intent liver surgery. ,Conclusions:, MSS mCRC patients may hold the opportunity of ICB responsiveness evoked by short-course oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy. The search for predictive biomarkers of ICB responsiveness is ongoing in the specifically designed METIMMOX correlative study program.

  ,Background:, Multiple myeloma (MM) typically affects older populations, which are more vulnerable to toxicity with anti-MM treatments. These patients (pts) have significant morbidity and mortality, resulting in a need for dose modifications or alternative suboptimal treatment options. Significant improvements were observed in the BOSTON study with XVd vs Vd in median progression-free survival (PFS), overall response rate (ORR), and rates of peripheral neuropathy (PN); median overall survival (OS) trended in favor of XVd. ,Methods:, The phase 3 randomized BOSTON trial (NCT03110562) is a controlled, open-label study of once weekly XVd vs. twice weekly standard Vd in pts with MM and 1-3 prior treatment regimens. We performed post-hoc analyses to compare survival benefits in pts ≥65 vs < 65 years of age. ,Results:, The BOSTON study enrolled a total of 402 pts between June 2017 and February 2019 that were randomized into XVd or Vd arms. The numbers of pts treated with XVd or Vd who were ≥65 were 109/132 and 86/75 who were < 65, respectively. Baseline characteristics were similar by age although pts ≥65 years were less likely to have received ASCT than those < 65 years (48.4% vs. 25.3%). Median PFS was prolonged with XVd compared with Vd, across both age groups: ≥65 (HR, 0.55 [95% CI, 0.37-0.83] P = 0.002) and < 65, (HR, 0. 74 [95% CI, 0.49-1.11], P = 0.07). Vd was associated with a lower ORR (64.4%) than treatment with XVd (76.1%) (OR, 1.77 [95% CI, 1.00-3.11], P = 0.024) in pts ≥65, while the ORR in those < 65 was 76.7% with XVd and 58.7% (OR, 2.33 [95% CI, 1.18-4.59], P = 0.007) with Vd. As of Jan 2021, the median OS for the overall population was not reached for both arms (HR = 0.86; p = 0.193), with 61 and 75 deaths in the XVd and Vd arms, respectively. Median OS was not reached in pts ≥65 with XVd and was 28.6 months with Vd (HR = 0.60; 95% CI, 0.38-0.94; p = 0.012), while there was no difference in the OS for pts < 65 (HR = 1.52; 95% CI, 0.86-2.68; p = 0.926). Pts ≥65 had a lower incidence of death with XVd as compared to Vd (29 vs 56) and there were 32 deaths with XVd and 19 with Vd in pts < 65. Grade ≥3 treatment-emergent adverse events were not observed more often in older compared to younger pts. Amongst pts ≥65, PN of any grade was lower with XVd (32.1%) compared to Vd (46.5%); (OR 0.57 [95% CI 0.34-0.97], p = 0.017), including a lower incidence of grade ≥3 PN (XVd 4.6% vs. Vd 11.6%). Pts < 65 followed a similar trend of PN AEs of any grade: XVd, 32.6%; Vd, 48.0% (OR 0.42 [95% CI 0.21-0.82], p = 0.006). ,Conclusions:, In an older patient population with a poor prognosis, XVd was associated with a significant survival benefit, improved PFS and OR with reduced PN, and requires relatively short and infrequent clinic visits. XVd may be a simple, effective regimen for pts ≥65 years of age. Clinical trial information: ,NCT03110562","Thierry Facon, Holger W.

  ,Background:, One-third of colorectal cancer (CRC) recurs following curative surgery and chemotherapy. Accordingly, novel methods are needed to predict recurrence to enable clinical course mitigating strategies. Serial monitoring of plasma by mass spectrometry (MS) and multi-omics modeling (MMO) of CRC relapse chronology provide the framework for liquid biopsy test development to supersede existing imaging modalities such as CT scans according to relapse related pathologies. We hypothesized that plasma MS and MMO analysis of relapse related pathologies can deconvolute high risk stratification for CRC recurrence within the cancer continuum of care pre/post-surgery and/or pre/post adjuvant chemotherapy (ACT). ,Methods:, 189 CRC patients (Stage I-III) underwent one of three treatment modalities: Modality 1 (Surgery followed by ACT), Modality 2 (Surgery only), Modality 3 (Neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery and ACT). Plasma samples (n = 441) were collected from patients before surgery, 30 days post-op, and every 3 months until death or month 24 whichever came first. The MMO approach was used to analyze biological features encompassing native peptides, proteins, metabolites, lipids, and ceramides. MMO panels were developed comprising the significantly perturbed features as per the treatment modalities. These panels were used to predict relapse from plasma collected pre-op, 30-day post-op or after adjuvant chemotherapy. CEA levels were monitored in parallel. ,Results:, Follow-up data was available for 135 patients (Stage I-III) and 25/135 had evidence of radiological recurrence. Irrespective of the treatment modality, longitudinal follow-up using the MMO panel was able to predict disease recurrence greater than 7 months before clinical progression was confirmed by CT scan. There was no significant correlation between longitudinal CEA levels and recurrence status, hence CEA levels alone did not provide any lead time advantage over the MMO panel or radiological surveillance. Kaplan-Meier (KM) survival analysis revealed that patients that were MMO panel positive had a poor survival irrespective of treatment modalities used: Modality 1 (HR = 6.2, p value = 0.003, test immediately post-surgery and immediately before ACT; HR = 31.6, p value = 0.01, test immediately after ACT); Modality 2 (HR = 11.2; p value = 0.01, test immediately after-surgery); Modality 3 (HR > 40, p value = 0.08, test immediately after neo-ACT and before-surgery; HR > 40, p value = 0.004, test immediately after-surgery). ,Conclusions:, The MMO panel predicts CRC recurrence several months prior to detection by conventional CT scans, thus providing opportunity for alternative therapeutic strategies much earlier in the disease course.","Xuanhui Liu, Yani Zhang, Xiurui Zhu, Sheeno P.

  ,Background:, About one third of patients with hormone-receptor-positive (HR+), HER2‐ primary breast cancer with residual invasive disease after neoadjuvant chemotherapy will relapse despite adjuvant endocrine therapy. Therapeutic inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and 6 (CDK 4/6) by palbociclib combined with endocrine therapy demonstrated highly relevant efficacy in metastatic breast cancer. The phase III PENELOPE-B (NCT01864746) study did not show a significant benefit from palbociclib in women with centrally confirmed HR+, HER2- primary breast cancer without a pathological complete response after taxane‐containing neoadjuvant chemotherapy and at high-risk of relapse (CPS‐EG score ≥3 or 2 and ypN+) for the primary endpoint (Loibl et al. JCO 2021). ,Methods:, After completion of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and locoregional therapy, PENELOPE-B patients were randomized (1:1) to receive 13 cycles (1 year) of palbociclib 125mg daily or placebo on days 1-21 in a 28d cycle in addition to standard endocrine therapy. Analysis of the primary endpoint of invasive disease-free survival (iDFS) was planned after 290 events. Secondary objective included iDFS in luminal-B group by treatment. Gene expression in post-neoadjuvant surgical residual tumor tissue samples was profiled using the HTG EdgeSeq Oncology Biomarker Panel targeting 2559 genes (HTG Molecular Diagnostics Inc.). Based on 91 genes of this panel the AIMS subtype (Paquet & Hallett, JNCI 2014) was calculated. ,Results:, Gene expressions were measured in tumors from 906 of 1250 (72%) PENELOPE-B patients; 663 had LumA subtype, 64 LumB, 135 NormL, 16 BasalL, and 28 HER2E. Compared to LumA the LumB patients were older, had higher post-neoadjuvant Ki-67, higher risk status (CPS-EG), and higher grade; no significant correlation was found for the region of participating sites, cT, ypT, and ypN. Patients with LumB tumors had an estimated 3-year iDFS of 71.9% with palbociclib vs 44.8% with placebo HR = 0.50 (0.24-1.05); outcome was similar in patients with LumA tumors (3-year iDFS 83.9% vs 79.5%, HR = 0.93 (0.68-1.28), interaction p = 0.132); this was confirmed in multivariable analyses. Ki-67 by IHC and proliferation biomarkers from the HTG panel also showed no significant interaction with treatment. ,Conclusions:, PENELOPE-B did not show a benefit from the addition of 1 year palbociclib to endocrine therapy compared to placebo in the total enrolled high-risk primary breast cancer population. However, the small group of luminal-B tumors (n = 64) derived benefit from palbociclib, although without a statistically significant interaction. Further investigation is required in a larger cohort to validate a palbociclib benefit that might be confined to this group.","Carsten Denkert, Frederik Marmé, Miguel Martin, Michael Untch, Herve R.

  ,Background:, This is a prospective international Survey to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the management of patients with gynecological malignancies from the multidisciplinary physicians' perspective, with particular focus on clincial infrastructures, and trial participation. ,Methods:, The anonymous online survey consisted of 53 COVID-related questions. It was sent to all healthcare professionals in gynaecological oncology centres across Europe and the Pan-Arabian region from April 2020 to October 2020. All healthcare professionals treating women with gynecological cancers were able to participate in the survey. ,Results:, A total of 243 answers were collected from 30 different countries. The majority (73%) of participants were gynecological oncologists from university hospitals(71%) with at least an Intensive care unit with cardiopulmonary support available at their institutions. Most institutions continued to perform elective surgeries only for oncological cases (98%). Patients had to wait on average 2 weeks longer for their surgery appointments compared to previous years(range 0-12 weeks). Cases that were prioritised for surgical intervention across all tumors (Ovarian, Endometrium, Cervical) were early stage disease (74%), primary situation (61%), and good ECOG status (63%). The radicality of surgery did not change in the majority of cases (78%) across all tumor types. During the pandemic, only 38% of clinicians stated they would start a new clinical trial. 45% stated the pandemic has negatively impacted the financial structure and support for clinical trials. 79% do not routinely screen patients included in trials for SARS CoV2. Overall, approx. 20% of clinicians did not feel well informed regarding clinical pathways for COVID-19 patients throughout the pandemic. The majority preferred regular updates and training via Webinars (75%), followed by tumorboards and interdisciplinary conferences (45%). 30% of clinicians stated that they are currently experiencing difficulties in providing adequate medical care due to staff shortage. ,Conclusions:, Despite well-established guidelines for patient care and performing clinical trials in gynecological oncology, the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted clinical research, and financial structures. Longer waiting times for operative interventions, less support for clinical trials and concerns regarding provision of adequate medical care and triaging patients are very real. This survey underlines the necessity for building robust emergency algorithms tailored to gynecological oncology patients in the future.","Sara Nasser, Christina Fotopoulou, Murat Guktekin, Desislava Dimitrova, Philippe Morice, Jalid Sehouli","North-Eastern German Society of Gynecological Oncology (NOGGO) and Department of Gynecology with Center for Oncological Surgery, Charité–University Medicine of Berlin, Campus Virchow Klinikum, Berlin, Germany, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom, Division of Gynecologic Oncology, Hacettepe University Faculty of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey, Department of Surgery, Gustave Roussy Cancer Centre, Villejuif, France","J Clin Oncol 39, 2021 (suppl 15; abstr 5564)",,2021 ASCO Annual Meeting,Online Only,None,Gynecologic Cancer,Poster Session,Gynecologic Cancer,Patient care and clinical trials in gynecological oncology: Implications of the COVID-19 pandemic.,Gynecologic Cancer

  ,Background:, Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) use is relatively common among cancer patients. Data regarding CAM use in Brazil is scarce. We sought to define CAM use among cancer patients and investigate factors that might influence it. ,Methods:, We conducted a cross-sectional survey of adults diagnosed with any cancer type who came to appointments at two cancer centers in Brazil from January 2020 to January 2021. Unadjusted and adjusted analyses were conducted by using Logistic Regression models to determine the association of covariates with binary outcome. Statistical analyses were performed with SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC). All tests were 2-sided, and P < 0.05 was considered significant. ,Results:, In total, 319 patients who consented to the face-to-face interview were included and all of them completed the questionnaires. Most patients (52.4%) were between 51 and 70 years-old, 59,6% were female, 85,2% were from the private service and 67% had college graduate/baccalaureate. Most cancer types were from gastrointestinal tract (31,4%), breast (20.4%), lung (12.3%) and genitourinary type. More than 85% of the participants were on any active cancer treatment. The prevalence of current CAM use was 34.2% and 50.2% of the patients did not believe CAM has anti-cancer properties. Two-thirds of the participants have never discussed about CAM with their oncologists. Only 4.1% of the respondents would abandon conventional cancer treatment in order to use just CAM. Among CAM users, 55% referred multiple therapies use. Of those therapies, spiritual surgery was the most prevalent one. There was a significant higher proportion of females reporting CAM use (p = 0,008) as well as a higher proportion of CAM use among private patients (p = 0,008). ,Conclusions:, CAM use was common among our study population, especially spiritual surgery. Women and private patients were more prone to use CAM. Although most patients would not abandon conventional treatment, many of them have never discussed about CAM with their oncologists.","Eliza Dalsasso Ricardo, Denise Oishi, Angel Ayumi Tome Uchiyama, Catarina Marchon da Silva, Josué Bravo Espinoza, Frederico Rafael Moreira, Marcelo Oliveira Dos Santos, Rachel Pimenta Riechelmann, Renata D'Alpino D'Alpino","Hospital Alemão Oswaldo Cruz, São Paulo, Brazil, Universidade Federal de São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil, Universidade Municipal de São Caetano do Sul, São Caetano do Sul, Brazil, Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia, San Martin De Porres, Peru, Hospital Santa Catarina, São Paulo, SP, Brazil, Instituto do Câncer do Estado de São Paulo, Universidade de São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil, Oncology Center Hospital São José, São Paulo, Brazil","J Clin Oncol 39, 2021 (suppl 15; abstr 12060)",,2021 ASCO Annual Meeting,Online Only,None,Symptoms and Survivorship,Poster Session,Symptoms and Survivorship,Complementary and alternative medicine use among cancer patients at two cancer centers in Brazil.,Symptoms and Survivorship

  ,Background:, A morphological subset of prostate cancer (PCa) circulating tumor cells (CTCs) with particularly small nuclei (< 8.5 μm), named very-small-nuclear CTCs (vsnCTCs), were found to be correlated with the presence of visceral metastases. It is reported that the depletion of nuclear envelope protein emerin promotes PCa metastasis and is associated with nuclear shape instability. In this study, we hypothesize vsnCTCs as prognostic biomarkers in metastatic castration resistant PCa (mCRPC), and aim to investigate the correlation between emerin level and vsnCTCs. ,Methods:, PCa CTCs were enriched using the NanoVelcro CTC Assay from 76 patients with mCRPC. The Kaplan-Meier analysis and log-rank test were used to estimate and compare the overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS) of androgen receptor signaling inhibitor (ARSI), taxanes and other therapy in patients stratified by the presence of vsnCTCs. The correlation between the presence of vsnCTCs and OS and PFS were evaluated using the Cox proportional hazard regression. The expression level of emerin in patients with and without vsnCTC were compared using Mann-Whitney U test, and the correlation between emerin level and CTC nuclear size was tested by Pearson correlation coefficient. ,Results:, Patients with vsnCTC (i.e, vsnCTC+) had significantly shortened OS and PFS compared with those without vsnCTC (i.e, vsnCTC-). The median OS was 34 (vsnCTC+, ,n,= 49) vs. 149 (vsnCTC-, ,n,= 27) weeks (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.6, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.5-4.5, ,P,< 0.001). The median PFS was 12 (vsnCTC+, ,n,= 32) vs. 26 (vsnCTC-, ,n,= 18) weeks (HR = 2.2, 95% CI: 1.3 -4.0, ,P,= 0.004). The emerin expression level was significantly higher in vsnCTC+ compared to vsnCTC- (,P,= 0.009). In addition, we observed a significantly positive correlation between emerin expression and CTC nuclear size (r = 0.52, ,P,< 0.001). ,Conclusions:, This study casts light on the importance of the vsnCTCs in patients with mCRPC, as vsnCTC+ patients represented a group at risk for faster clinical progression who are at the highest risk for mortality. vsnCTC represents a new hallmark of an aggressive subtype of mCRPC and is related to emerin dysregulation, which promotes lethal progression and metastasis of PCa.","Jasmine Jiemei Wang, Karen Angelica Cavassani, Pai-Chi Teng, Jie-Fu Chen, Yu Jen Jan, Gina Chia-Yi Chu, Yi-Te Lee, Allen Gao, Dolores Di Vizio, Leland WK Chung, Sungyong You, Yazhen Zhu, Michael Freeman, Andre Rogatko, Ju Dong Yang, Hsian-Rong Tseng, Edwin Melencio Posadas","Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA, Samuel Oschin Comprehensive Cancer Institute, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, University of California Davis Comprehensive Cancer Center, Sacramento, CA, California NanoSystems Institute, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, West Hollywood, CA","J Clin Oncol 39, 2021 (suppl 15; abstr e17008)",,2021 ASCO Annual Meeting,,"U.S. National Institutes of Health, DoD Other Government Agency, the Steven Spielberg Discovery Fund in Prostate Cancer Research, the St. Anthony Prostate Cancer Research Fund, the CD McKinnon Memorial Fund for Neuroendocrine Prostate Cancer, the Michael & Patricia Berns Family Fund, the Prostate Cancer Foundation Creativity Award and Stuart Rahr Young Investigator Award","Publication Only: Genitourinary Cancer—Prostate, Testicular, and Penile",,"Genitourinary Cancer—Prostate, Testicular, and Penile",A morphological subset of circulating tumor cells in advanced prostate cancer reveals a potential biomarker for clinical outcomes.,"Genitourinary Cancer—Prostate, Testicular, and Penile"

  ,Background:, Helping seriously-ill cancer patients identify and communicate their preferences for care can increase satisfaction, decrease anxiety and depression, and result in less intensive, hospital-based end-of-life medical care. We developed an intervention designed to elicit patients’ preferences and goals for care and share them with their family and care teams. We sought to pilot-test the feasibility and acceptability of this intervention in advanced cancer patients. ,Methods:, We enrolled advanced-stage cancer patients and their clinicians at an academic and community oncology practice. Eligibility criteria included: patients with metastatic solid tumors and ≥2 prior lines of therapy or patients for whom oncologists indicated that they “would not be surprised” if the patient died within 6 months. Participants watched a 2.5 minute video which prompted them to think about how they define “a good day;” completed a 3-page brief questionnaire, which was shared with their care team; and were given a wallet card with question prompts. The primary outcomes were feasibility (i.e., ≥60% approach-to-consent ratio among eligible patients, ≥60% of participants rated the intervention positively) and acceptability (i.e., ≥60% of participants would recommend the intervention to patients like them). Secondary outcomes, measured pre- and post-intervention, included patient anxiety and distress, hope, quality of life, and therapeutic alliance with their care team. ,Results:, Among 59 potentially eligible patients approached, 53 agreed to participate (90% approach-to-consent ratio). Four patients were non-evaluable because they died before study completion. Among the 49 remaining participants (mean age = 63 years, range 40-86 years), all completed the intervention. Overall, 45 of 49 patients (92%) rated their experience as excellent, very good, or good. Most participants agreed or strongly agreed that they would recommend the video (83%), brief questionnaire (88%), and wallet card (63%) to patients with cancers like theirs. However, only 34% of participants reported having an opportunity to review the questionnaire with their oncologist. There were no increases in patient anxiety or distress associated with the intervention or reductions in hope, quality of life, or therapeutic alliances with oncologists (all P > 0.05). ,Conclusions:, A communication intervention that combined a video, questionnaire, and wallet card was both feasible and acceptable for helping advanced cancer patients identify their care preferences and goals. Future studies should examine combining this with an intervention that primes clinicians to engage in goals of care discussions with advanced-stage cancer patients.

  ,Background:, ISB 1342 is a bispecific antibody heterodimer based on the Ichnos proprietary Bispecific Engagement by Antibodies based on T cell receptor (BEAT) platform. ISB 1342 is a first-in-class CD38 T cell engager under investigation in subjects with relapsed multiple myeloma refractory to proteasome inhibitors (PIs), immunomodulators (IMiDs) and daratumumab (study ISB 1342-101). ,Methods:, ISB 1342 was engineered with a single chain variable fragment (scFv) arm that specifically recognizes a cluster of differentiation (CD)3-epsilon (CD3ε) and a fragment antigen binding (Fab) arm which specifically recognizes CD38 and does not compete with daratumumab. By co-engaging CD3ε on T cells and CD38 on tumor cells, ISB 1342 redirects T cells to kill CD38-expressing tumor cells. This mechanism of action is differentiated from existing monospecific CD38 targeting therapies and was designed to overcome resistance to daratumumab in multiple myeloma. ,Results:,In vitro,, ISB 1342 killed a large range of CD38-expressing tumor cell lines (EC50:12 to 90 pM) with 8 to 239-fold superior efficacy than daratumumab. ISB 1342 was also able to efficiently kill CD38 low-intermediate-expressing tumor cells that were poorly killed by daratumumab. ISB 1342 retained the potency to kill CD38 low-intermediate-expressing tumor cells when used in sequential or concomitant combination with daratumumab. In addition, the presence of soluble CD38 or glucocorticoid did not impact ISB 1342 killing potency. ISB 1342 was constructed with a double LALA mutation that dampens the binding to Fcγ receptors and C1q. Consistently, ISB 1342 showed only residual Fc-mediated effector functions and its mechanism of tumor cell killing critically relies on the engagement and the activation of T lymphocytes. ISB 1342 showed a favorable on target specificity profile ,in vitro, and was unable to activate T cells in the absence of CD38 positive target cells. Further, ISB 1342-induced tumor cell killing was not associated with a detectable T cell fratricide ,in vitro,. Finally, the potency of ISB 1342 was assessed ,in vivo, in a therapeutic model of a subcutaneously established Daudi tumor co-xenografted with human PBMCs. In marked contrast to daratumumab, which induced only a partial tumor control, ISB 1342 induced complete tumor eradication when injected intravenously weekly at 0.5 mg/kg. As anticipated, the ISB 1342 control molecule (ISB 1342_13DU) made of an irrelevant CD38 binder failed to control tumor growth. The release of the Granzyme A and B, TNF-alpha and CXCL-10 in the tumor micro-environment one week post-treatment was strongly and significantly increased by ISB 1342 but not by daratumumab and ISB 1342_13DU; this represents a correlate of anti-tumor immunity associated with ISB 1342 efficacy ,in vivo,. ,Conclusions:, Hence the higher potency of ISB 1342 relative to daratumumab supports the ongoing clinical development in multiple myeloma patients.","Marie-Agnès Doucey, Blandine Pouleau, Carole Estoppey, Cian Stutz, Amelie Croset, Amélie Laurendon, Thierry Monney, Mégane Pluess, Christelle Ries-Fecourt, Julie Macoin, Riccardo Turrini, Perrine Suere, M.Lamine Mbow, Emilie Nallet, Adam Drake, Mario Perro, Stanislas Blein","Ichnos Sciences, Epalinges, Switzerland","J Clin Oncol 39, 2021 (suppl 15; abstr 8044)",,2021 ASCO Annual Meeting,Online Only,Glenmark and Ichnos Sciences,Hematologic Malignancies—Plasma Cell Dyscrasia,Poster Session,Hematologic Malignancies,ISB 1342: A first-in-class CD38 T cell engager for the treatment of relapsed refractory multiple myeloma.,Hematologic Malignancies

  ,Background:, Single agent programmed cell death protein 1 (PD1) inhibitor is ineffective against mismatch repair proficient (MMRp) colon cancer with response rates in single digits. Polyinosinic-Polycytidylic (Poly-ICLC) is a synthetic double stranded ribonucleic acid that generates inflammatory response increasing epitope recognition, develops tumor reactive T cells and induces interferon production which increases PD-L1 expression. In this trial, we test the effectiveness of combination of poly-ICLC and pembrolizumab in MMRp metastatic colon cancer. ,Methods:, In this open label, single arm, single institution, phase 2 study, we enrolled 12 MMRp metastatic colon cancer patients from 1/25/2019 to 2/10/2021. Eligible patients had histologically confirmed MMRp metastatic colon cancer, ECOG 1-2 and progression on at least 2 lines of therapy. Treatment (Tx) consisted of Pembrolizumab (200 mg q3 weeks) and poly-ICLC (2 mg twice weekly, 3 days apart) for 1 year of treatment. Tx continued until progression, discontinuation or withdrawal. The primary endpoint was objective response rate by RECIST 1.1. Secondary endpoints included duration of response, adverse event profiling, progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Intention-to-treat analyses (ITT) included all patient receiving at least one dose of the study agent. ,Results:, 12 patients with median age 68.5 years (range 54-75) and 33% (4/12) male had been enrolled till 2/10/2021. Objective response rate was 8.3% (1 patient had partial response). The duration of response was 196 days. Among these 12 patients, median PFS was 63.5 days and median OS was 196 days. Treatment related adverse events of any grade were reported in 12/12 (100%) patients with the most common toxicities being nausea, vomiting, anorexia, dehydration and dizziness. 3/12 (25%) had serious (grade ≥ 3) toxicities and one patient died after experiencing leukocytosis, dehydration and hyperbilirubinemia attributed to the trial drugs. ,Conclusions:, Poly-ICLC was not effective in combination with pembrolizumab for MMRp metastatic colon cancer in 3rd line setting and it did not seem to improve response rates to immunotherapy.

  ,Background:, National guidelines recommend biomarker testing in mNSCLC, and targeted therapy is associated with improved outcomes. The aim of this study was to understand the real-world biomarker testing and treatment patterns in the community setting. ,Methods:, This was a retrospective study of adult patients diagnosed with de novo mNSCLC between 01-Jan-2016 and 30-Sep-2019, with follow-up through 31-Dec-2019 using The US Oncology Network structured electronic health records data. Patients who received systemic treatment for mNSCLC were included. ,Results:, A total of 3213 patients were identified with median age 68 years (24, 90+); 52.7% were male and 10% were current smokers. ECOG score was 0-1 in 55.2%; 60% had adenocarcinoma, 16% had squamous cell carcinoma, and the rest had other/unknown histology. Since most of the biomarker-guided therapies were approved after 2016, testing patterns are described for 2017-2019 (n=2257). Overall, 23.6% were not tested for any biomarker (PD-L1 or driver mutation [DM]) at any time during the study period, and only 49% had a biomarker test result prior to 1L treatment. We observed similar patterns when assessing DM specifically; 35.8% were never tested for DM, and only 39.3% had a DM test result prior to 1L treatment. As an example, out of 42 ALK+ patients in this study population, only 5 had test results prior to 1L treatment and only 3 received an ALK inhibitor as their 1L treatment (Table). Similar patterns were observed for the other biomarkers. ,Conclusions:, Despite availability of promising biomarker-based therapies, the lack of adequate testing in the community oncology setting means that not all eligible patients are receiving the most effective therapies upfront. Nearly 61% of patients had no DM test reported before 1L treatment in this mNSCLC cohort (all histologies), and some were determined to be DM positive at a later time, highlighting a missed opportunity to employ the most effective biomarker-directed front-line treatment. Next steps in this study will include assessing patterns by histology. Structured data, which are recorded for clinical management, might have gaps; future research with chart reviews could provide a more comprehensive assessment.","Eric S.

  ,Background:, Early response parameters such as early tumor shrinkage (ETS), depth of response (DpR), and time to DpR represent exploratory endpoints that may serve as early efficacy endpoints and potential predictors of long-term outcome. We analyzed the association of these endpoints with bevacizumab-based sequential (initial fluoropyrimidines) versus combination (initial fluoropyrimidines plus irinotecan) chemotherapy within a randomized phase III trial. ,Methods:, DpR (change from baseline to smallest tumor diameter), ETS (≥20% reduction in tumor diameter at first reassessment), and time to DpR (study randomization to DpR-image) were analyzed in the XELAVIRI-trial. Moreover, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were evaluated with ETS as stratification parameter (ETS vs. no ETS) according to treatment arm, molecular subgroup, and sex. ,Results:, 370 patients were available for analysis of early treatment response parameters. A higher rate of ETS (60.9% vs. 43.5%; p = 0.001) and significantly greater DpR (-40.0% vs. -24.7%; p < 0.001) were observed in the initial combination compared to the sequential therapy arm, respectively. The improvement of ETS and DpR was pronounced in the subpopulation of ,RAS,/,BRAF, wildtype patients. Male in contrast to female patients significantly benefitted from initial combination treatment in terms of median DpR (male: -40.0% vs. -22.2%; p < 0.001; female: -34.0% vs. -24.4%; p = 0.13) and rate of ETS (male: 64.8% vs. 40.2%; p < 0.001; female: 52.5% vs. 49.3%; p = 0.73). Achievement of ETS correlated with improved survival irrespective of treatment arm (PFS: p < 0.001; OS: p = 0.012) and molecular subgroup (PFS: p < 0.001; OS: p < 0.001). Whereas the survival benefit in male patients achieving ETS was statistically significant (PFS: p < 0.001, HR 0.532 (0.409-0.692); OS: p < 0.001, HR 0.574 (0.437-0.756)), there were no significant differences in PFS (p = 0.107) and OS (p = 0.965) of female patients depending on ETS. ,Conclusions:, In the XELAVIRI trial, initial irinotecan-based combination therapy with bevacizumab improves ETS and DpR in mCRC patients. Improvement in early response parameters appears pronounced in patients with ,RAS,/,BRAF, wildtype tumors suggesting a high sensitivity to irinotecan-based treatment. ETS was predictive of PFS and OS regardless of treatment arm. This finding was rather driven by male than female patients, potentially indicating that ETS might be less predictive of long-term outcome in an elderly, female population.","Annika Kurreck, Volker Heinemann, Ludwig Fischer von Weikersthal, Thomas Decker, Florian Kaiser, Jens Uhlig, Michael Schenk, Jens Freiberg-Richter, Bettina Peuser, Claudio Denzlinger, Ullrich Graeven, Kathrin Heinrich, Swantje Held, Arndt Stahler, Annabel Helga Sophie Alig, Ivan Jelas, Jobst C. von Einem, Sebastian Stintzing, Clemens Giessen-Jung, Dominik Paul Modest","Charité University Medicine Berlin, Berlin, Germany, University Hospital Munich, LMU Munich, Munich, Germany, Department of Oncology, Gesundheitszentrum St. Marien GmbH, Amberg, Germany, Onkologie Ravensburg, Ravensburg, Germany, VK&K Studienzentrum, Landshut, Germany, Medical Practice for Hematology and Oncology Muldental, Naunhof, Germany, Hospital Barmherzige Brüder Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany, Oncological Practice, Dresden, Germany, Oncological Practice, Leipzig, Germany, Marienhospital Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany, Kliniken Maria Hilf GmbH, Klinik für Hämatologie, Onkologie und Gastroenterologie, Mönchengladbach, Germany, Department of Medicine III, University Hospital, LMU Munich, München, Germany, Munich, Germany, ClinAssess GmbH, Leverkusen, Germany, Medical Department,, Munich, Germany, Medical Department, Divison of Hematology, Oncology, and Tumor Immunology (CCM), Charité Universitaetsmedizin, Berlin, Germany, Charité Comprehensive Cancer Center, Berlin, Germany, Department of Medicine III, University Hospital, Munich, Germany, Medical Department, Division of Hematology, Oncology, and Tumor Immunology (CCM), Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany, Department of Medicine III, University Hospital, LMU Munich, Munich, Germany","J Clin Oncol 39, 2021 (suppl 15; abstr 3571)",,2021 ASCO Annual Meeting,Online Only,Arbeitsgemeinschaft Internistische Onkologie,Gastrointestinal Cancer—Colorectal and Anal,Poster Session,Gastrointestinal Cancer—Colorectal and Anal,"Treatment responses and disease dynamics in patients with untreated metastatic colorectal cancer receiving bevacizumab-based sequential versus combination chemotherapy: Analysis of a phase 3 trial (AIO KRK0110, XELAVIRI study).",Gastrointestinal Cancer—Colorectal and Anal

  ,Background:, The majority of data for IO in melanoma stems from trials that have specific inclusion criteria and often exclude important populations. In this analysis, we present the first real-world evidence of outcomes for stage IV patients (pts) with cutaneous melanoma receiving IO from 2015–2017 (addition of anti-PD-1 therapies) and factors associated with receipt of IO, and compare these outcomes with pts receiving IO (likely interferon and interleukin-2) from 2004–2010, and IO (addition of ipilimumab) from 2011–2014. ,Methods:, The NCDB was analyzed to identify pts with stage IV melanoma from 2004–2017. Pts were categorized into receipt of IO or not during time periods 2004–2010, 2011–2014, and 2015–2017. Overall survival (OS) was analyzed by Kaplan-Meier, log-rank, and Cox proportional hazard models; IO status was analyzed using logistic regression. ,Results:, 24,544 pts were analyzed from 2004–2017. Overall, 5,238 pts (21.3%) that received IO had improved median OS compared to those that did not (20.2 vs. 7.4 mos; p<0.0001). 4.1% received IO from 2004-2010, 7.8% from 2011-2014, and 9.4% from 2015-2017. Three-year OS significantly improved in pts treated with IO across treatment years; p<0.0001 (Table). Similarly, median time to IO initiation improved over time: 62 days in 2011-2014 vs. 49 days in 2015-2017 (p<0.0001). In the overall cohort, age<65 years, female gender, private insurance, no comorbidities, residence in metropolitan area, and treatment at academic centers were associated with better OS (p<0.0001 for all). Race was not associated with differences in OS (p=0.07). Multivariate analysis for 2015-2017 demonstrated that lack of treatment with IO [HR 1.98, 95%CI 1.81-2.17], radiation therapy [HR 1.20, 95%CI 1.09-1.32], presence of liver metastases [HR 1.87, 95%CI 1.63-2.13], and lack of surgery [HR 1.68, 95%CI 1.45-1.93] were independently associated with worse OS (p<0.0001 for all). In multivariate analysis, receipt of IO from 2015-2017, was associated with age<65 years [OR 1.27, 95%CI 1.08-1.50], African American race [OR 5.88, 95%CI 1.60-28.58], lack of comorbidities [OR 1.43, 95%CI 1.23-1.66], and treatment at academic centers [OR 1.44, 95%CI 1.26-1.65] (p<0.05 for all). ,Conclusions:, OS was improved in stage IV melanoma pts receiving IO, with the highest OS rate in 2015-2017. Our findings that represent a real-world population are consistent with recent trials, like KEYNOTE 006 and CheckMate 067 where 3-year OS for anti-PD-1 therapy was 50% and 52%, respectively. In our study, African Americans demonstrate a 5-fold increase in likelihood of receiving IO, a population underrepresented in clinical trials.

  ,Background:, The immunomodulatory effects of the tumor microenvironment (TME) significantly impact the T cell repertoire resulting in different anti-tumor immune responses. Previous work by our group and others has highlighted intratumor heterogeneity in T cell clonality, spatial distribution, and diversity, as well as infiltration of bystander T cells in early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, little is known about how the TME impacts the T cell repertoire in distant or surrounding adjacent uninvolved lung tissue. ,Methods:, We investigated the interplay between tumor and surrounding lung tissues by investigating the T cell repertoire at the tumor site, tumor margin, and 1cm, 2cm, 5cm, and 10cm away from the tumor as well as in peripheral blood in 21 NSCLC patients with a total of 123 samples undergoing T cell receptor (TCR) CDR3b sequencing using the Geneplus technology. Differences in regional T cell repertoires were analyzed based on clonality, diversity, and Morisita Overlap Index (MOI). GLIPH was utilized to identify motifs associated with pathogen specificity in each region. ,Results:, Clonality was lowest within the tumor and progressively increases from tumor margin to tumor adjacent lung toward distant lung with “hot spot” regions of T cell expansion located in adjacent lung tissue proximal to the tumor, namely 2cm away (p = 0.0025). Dominant T cell populations were better conserved between the tumor margins and “hot regions” of high clonality compared to the tumors (p = 0.0009) highlighting the differences between these environments and possible T cell exclusion in immunosuppressive TME. GLIPH analysis revealed an inverse correlation between clonality and the proportion of pathogen-associated TCR motifs (r = -0.83, p = 0.0195). Interestingly, tumor tissue contained the highest proportion of predicted pathogen TCRs whereas regions of high clonality contained the lowest (p < 0.0001), suggesting the antigen-independent nature of T cell trafficking. ,Conclusions:, Combined, these results highlight isolated pockets of T cell expansion in the lungs outside the tumor and potential immune evasion mechanisms in NSCLC.","Meredith Frank, Fenglei Yu, Alexandre Reuben, Muyun Peng, Gao Yang, Xiaofeng Chen, Liyan Ji, Pansong Li, Xuefeng Xia, Yan-Fang Guan, Jianjun Zhang","University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, Department of Thoracic Surgery, The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University, Changsha, China, Department of Thoracic and Head and Neck Medical Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, Department of Thoracic Surgery, No.2 Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, China, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, China, The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University, Changsha, China, Geneplus-Beijing, Geneplus-Beijing Institute, Beijing, China, Geneplus-Beijing Institute, Beijing, China, Geneplus-Beijing, Beijing, China, Department of Thoracic and Head and Neck Medical Oncology, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Department of Genomic Medicine, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX","J Clin Oncol 39, 2021 (suppl 15; abstr e20544)",,2021 ASCO Annual Meeting,,NSFC,Publication Only: Lung Cancer—Non-Small Cell Local-Regional/Small Cell/Other Thoracic Cancers,,Lung Cancer,Spatial analysis of the T-cell repertoire in non-small cell lung cancer reveals a clonality gradient from the tumor to the distal lung.,Lung Cancer

  ,Background:, Fibroblast activation protein (FAP)-expressing cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF), a major component of tumor stroma, confer treatment resistance, promote local progression, metastasis and immunosuppression. Because FAP is selectively expressed in the tumor stroma of many cancers, radiolabeled small molecule ligands targeting FAP are being explored for their use as pan-cancer theranostic agents. The objective was to establish the spectrum of FAP expression across various cancers by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and to explore whether 68Ga-FAPi-46 PET image biodistribution faithfully reflects tumor FAP expression from resected tumor and non-tumor specimens. ,Methods:, This study was a prospective, exploratory, imaging trial in cancer patients. Referred volunteer patients scheduled to undergo surgical resection of the primary tumor and/or metastases were eligible. Patients underwent one whole body 68Ga-FAPi-46 PET/CT scan. Subsequently, patients underwent surgical resection of the primary tumor and/or metastasis. The outcome measure was the correlation of 68Ga-FAPi-46 PET maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) with FAP IHC score in patient-matched cancer and non-cancer tissue. ,Results:, The frequency of FAP expression across 14 cancers on tissue microarrays ranged from 25 to 100% (mean 76.6±25.3%). For imaging and IHC correlation, fifteen patients with the following cancer types were prospectively included: colorectal (n = 4), head and neck (n = 3), pancreas (n = 2), breast (n = 2),stomach (n = 1), esophagus (n = 2) and uterus (n = 1). All 15 patients underwent surgery following their 68Ga-FAPi-46 PET scan within a mean time interval of 16.1±14.4 days (range 1 – 50 days). For two patients the tumor was deemed unresectable. 68Ga-FAPi-46 SUVmax and IHC scores were higher in cancer tissue than in normal tissue: mean 68Ga-FAPi-46 SUVmax 7.4±4.6 (range 1.5-15.9) vs 1.6±1.2 (range 0.4-5.1), (p < 0.001) and mean FAP IHC score 2.38±0.65 vs 0.54±0.66 (p < 0.001), respectively. The FAP IHC scores strongly correlated with 68Ga-FAPi-46 SUVmax (p = 0.001, repeated measures correlation r = 0.85 (95% CI 0.53-0.95), p < 0.001). ,Conclusions:, 68Ga-FAPi-46 PET biodistribution across multiple cancers strongly correlates with FAP tissue expression as measured by IHC. This translational validation paves the way for large scale prospective trials on the use of 68Ga-FAPi-46 PET/CT as a biomarker and stratification tool for FAP-targeted therapies.

  ,Background:, Cilta-cel (JNJ-68284528) is a chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T)-cell therapy with 2 BCMA-targeting, single-domain antibodies designed to confer high avidity binding. CARTITUDE-2 (NCT04133636) is a phase 2, multicohort, open-label study assessing the efficacy and safety of cilta-cel in patients (pts) with MM in various clinical settings. Here, we describe the mitigation and management strategies implemented to identify and reduce the risk for neurologic adverse events (AEs) in Cohort A pts (progressive MM after 1−3 prior lines of therapy). ,Methods:, Eligible pts (≥18 years of age) had MM per IMWG criteria, measurable disease, ECOG ≤1, progressive disease after 1−3 prior lines of therapy (including a PI and IMiD) and were lenalidomide refractory (no prior BCMA-targeting agent). Cilta-cel (0.75×10,6, [range 0.5–1.0×10,6,] CAR+ viable T cells/kg) was given as a single infusion 5–7 days after start of lymphodepletion (cyclophosphamide 300 mg/m,2, + fludarabine 30 mg/m,2, daily for 3 days). Monitoring and mitigation strategies for neurologic AEs include providing more effective bridging therapy to reduce tumor burden prior to lymphodepletion, frequent assessment of CAR-T-related ICANS using the ICE tool, regular handwriting assessments to detect micrographia, and neuroimaging (brain MRI) and EEG for pts with prior neurologic disease. Management strategies include evaluating infectious and paraneoplastic etiologies upon observation of ICANS ≥Grade (gr) 1, administration of tocilizumab (if concurrent CRS, all gr of ICANS) and/or dexamethasone (gr 2/3) or methylprednisolone (gr 4). ICANS and CRS were graded by ASTCT criteria; neurotoxicities not classified as ICANS were graded per CTCAE Version 5.0. ,Results:, As of 15 Jan 2021 (median follow-up: 5.8 months [range: 2.5–9.8 months]), 20 pts in Cohort A received cilta-cel. Median age was 60 years (range: 38–75); 65% were male. Neurotoxicities occurred in 4 pts (20%). Three pts had ICANS (gr 1/2); median time to onset of symptoms was 8 days (range: 7–11) and median duration was 2 days (range: 1–2). Two of the 3 pts received supportive measures to treat ICANS, including levetiracetam and steroids; all 3 had concurrent CRS and all recovered. One pt developed isolated facial paralysis (gr 2) on Day 29 after cilta-cel infusion, and recovered 51 days after the onset of event following treatment with dexamethasone for 28 days. No movement or neurocognitive disorders were reported. ,Conclusions:, Neurologic AEs were generally manageable in pts with MM following treatment with cilta-cel. With a median of 5.8 months of follow-up, there were no movement or neurocognitive disorders in pts from Cohort A. These results suggest that early detection and management of neurologic AEs can lead to better treatment outcomes. Clinical trial information: ,NCT04133636","Hermann Einsele, Samir S.

  ,Background:, Neurotrophin receptor tyrosine kinase (,NTRK,) gene fusions are rare but actionable oncogenic drivers that are present in a wide variety of solid tumors. This study aims to identify the frequency and the clinicopathologic and genetic features of ,NTRK,-driven colorectal cancers (CRC). ,Methods:, Colonic and rectal tumor DNA specimen from colorectal cancer patients submitted for molecular profiling at a CLIA-certified genomics laboratory in China that performed ,NTRK1/2/3, fusion detection by hybridization-based targeted next generation sequencing (NGS) were retrospectively reviewed. Patients’ demographic, clinical characteristics, and treatment history were retrieved from the database for further evaluation. ,Results:, A total of 2,519 unique Chinese colorectal cancer cases were profiled from April 2016 to May 2020, and 17 ,NTRK+, fusion events were identified (0.7%, 17/2,519) consisting of 14 cases of ,NTRK1+, and 3 cases of ,NTRK3+, fusions. Furthermore, thirteen out of 17 ,NTRK+, CRC tumors (76%) were microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) tumors, a much higher rate than that of the molecularly unselected CRC population (8%) or ,NTRK+, non-CRC tumors ( < 1%). ,NTRK+, CRC patients also had increased tumor mutation burden (median TMB = 65 mut/MB) compared to that of non-,NTRK+, CRC (median TMB = 7.7 mut/MB) or ,NTRK+, non-CRC tumors (median TMB = 4 mut/MB). ,POLE/POLD1, mutations were also enriched in ,NTRK+, CRC (8/17, 47%) relative to molecularly unstratified CRC patients (8%) with over half carrying concurrent ,POLE, and ,POLD1, mutations. ,TPM3, was the most common fusion partner of ,NTRK1, (78%, ,N, = 14), followed by ,LMNA, and ,TRP,. Three ,NTRK3+, CRC were identified ,(ETV6-NTRK3, RUNX1-NTRK3, CSNK1G1-NTRK3),. ,RNF43, (71%) was the most frequently mutated gene and the aberrations of ,RNF43, and ,ARID1, were significantly enriched in MSI-positive ,NTRK+, tumors as compared to the MSS ,NTRK+, subgroup. ,TP53, (53%) and ,APC, (35%) aberrations frequently co-occurred with ,NTRK, fusions, whereas the majority of the ,NTRK+, cohort were ,RAS/BRAF,wildtype,, except in one case that an oncogenic ,KRAS, Q61R variant co-occurred with ,RUNX1-NTRK3.,Conclusions:,NTRK,+ colorectal cancer is rare.

  ,Background:, The American Cancer Society (ACS) published Diet and Physical Activity Guidelines in 2020. Emerging evidence suggests that healthy dietary patterns are associated with reduced cancer risk, especially colon and breast. ACS estimates there are 3.5 million breast cancer survivors in the US. The transition from active treatment into survivorship is a critical period where they are uniquely positioned to adapt healthy behaviors, yet there is a lack of empirical research to best guide the transition. ,Methods:, We developed an 8-week breast cancer survivorship program to educate and develop healthy habits. 40 participants were recruited through Moffitt breast and survivorship clinics, social media, and website. Weekly topics were: cancer survivorship, nutrition, emotional health and well-being, exercise, medical management after treatment, grocery store tour, meditation and mindful eating, and moving forward. To assess health-related quality of life (QoL), we used FACT-G Version 4, a validated patient-reported survey with 27 questions and 4 domains of wellbeing (physical, social/family, emotional, and functional) on a 5-point Likert scale (not at all to very much). Similarly, a nutrition questionnaire evaluated the understanding of healthy choices, confidence in making healthy changes, knowing how to purchase healthy foods and read nutrition labels, confidence in preparing healthy foods, and understanding of a plant-based diet. Surveys were administered pre- and post-intervention. Data analysis included those who completed both (n = 30). Pt characteristics and data trends were summarized using descriptive statistics. Paired Wilcoxon rank sum tests were used to assess the significance of the change in scores between surveys. ,Results:, Participant ages ranged from 41 to 77. The majority (34.5%) completed treatment 13-24 months prior. Compared to baseline, greater proportions of participants had positive responses after intervention in all nutrition questions. The nutrition sum was significantly increased by 3.07 (p = 0.0001). There was no significant change in overall QoL (-1.77; p = 0.1178) or sub-domain wellbeing scores. ,Conclusions:, Our 8-week intervention for breast cancer survivors showed significant improvement in nutrition domain. While a small sample size is limiting, it is evident that survivors can improve their confidence in making healthy changes and develop better understanding of a plant-based diet.","Poorvi Kirit Desai, Diane Riccardi, Heewon L.

  ,Background:, As systemic therapy for metastatic breast cancer (BC) improves, effective treatment for central nervous system involvement has become a major concern, as 10%‒30% of such patients develop brain metastases (BMs). The survival benefit from hormonal and targeted therapy urges to treat patients with BMs with minimal toxicity and less systemic interruption. Here we assessed survival and disease control in patients who received upfront stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). ,Methods:, We retrospectively reviewed 236 patients who received upfront SRS with/without surgery for BMs from metastatic BC at a single large-volume cancer center from June 2007 to May 2018. We excluded patients who received SRS for surgical cavity alone. A total of 212 were evaluable, of whom 68 had triple-negative (TN), 66 HR+/HER2-, 46 HR+/HER2+, and 32 HER2+ molecular subtypes. Primary endpoints were overall survival (OS) from BM diagnosis and salvage radiation free survival (SRTFS), which were estimated by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Cox proportional hazard regression analysis was used to identify prognostic factors. ,Results:, Median age at BM diagnosis was 52.5 y (range 25.6‒85.4); median Karnofsky Performance Score (KPS) was 90 (range 60‒100); and median number of BMs treated was 2 (range 1‒17). At a median follow-up time of 15.4 months (mo) (range, 0.8–119.6), the estimated median OS was 18.5 mo (95% CI, 14.9–21). Factors associated with OS on multivariate analysis (MVA) were subtype (12.2 mo for TN, 13.3 mo for HR+/HER2-, 36.4 mo for HR+/HER2+, and 28.1 mo for HER2+, ,p,= 0.002), KPS (,p <,0.0001), receipt of chemotherapy (,p,= 0.016) or anti HER2+ therapy (0.029) after diagnosis of BM, and type of salvage radiation (,p <,0.0001). Age, extracranial disease status at BM diagnosis, or receipt of upfront surgery was not associated with OS. OS was also comparable in patients who received upfront SRS to less or more than 4 lesions (19.3 mo for < 4 [n = 162] vs. 17.8 mo for > / = 4 [n = 50], ,p,= 0.36). Of the 106 patients (50%) who received salvage therapy after initial SRS, 42 received salvage SRS, 28 received salvage whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT), and 36 received both. The 12-month salvage RT rate was 25% for WBRT and 26.4% for SRS. The median SRTFS was 7.4 mo (95% CI, 6.5‒8.3). Factors associated with SRTFS on MVA were subtype (,p,= 0.002), KPS (,p,= 0.011), and receipt of Hormone therapy after a diagnosis of BM (p = 0.031). ,Conclusions:, Molecular subtypes of HER2+ and HR+/HER2+, good KPS, and receipt of chemotherapy or anti-HER2 therapy predicted better OS for patients who received upfront SRS for BMs from BC. Number of BMs treated by upfront SRS was not associated with OS. Molecular subtype, KPS, and receipt of Hormone therapy were also associated with SRTFS. Prospective studies are needed to clarify the best treatment strategies for the various subgroups of patients with BMs from BC particularly in the era of increasing use of new systemic therapies.","Yan Wang, Ran An, Fuchenchu Wang, Akshara Singareeka Raghavendra, Chao Gao, Yon Son Betty Kim, Tina Marie Briere, Diana Amaya, Jing Li","University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, The Fourth Hospital of Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, China, University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, MD Anderson Cancer Center, The University of Texas, Houston, TX","J Clin Oncol 39, 2021 (suppl 15; abstr e14013)",,2021 ASCO Annual Meeting,,None,Publication Only: Central Nervous System Tumors,,Central Nervous System Tumors,Survival and disease control after upfront stereotactic radiosurgery for brain metastases from breast cancer.,Central Nervous System Tumors

  ,Background:, Low intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPU) in conjunction with intravenous microbubbles can transiently and reversibly disrupt the blood-brain barrier (BBB), allowing for an increase in the tissue concentration of chemotherapy agents in the brain. Mass spectrometry data from preclinical models (mouse, swine) showed a > 5x enhancement in carboplatin brain concentrations, which correlated well with the spatial distribution of a Gadolinium (Gd) contrast agent used for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). ,Methods:, The primary objective of this phase I/IIa study (NCT03744026) was to demonstrate the safety of BBB disruption using LIPU in patients with recurrent glioblastoma. This study was a 3+3 design using escalating numbers (3, 6, 9) of activated 1 MHz ultrasound emitters. Nine patients were treated in the escalation phase and another 12 patients were treated with 9 emitters in the expansion phase. Eligibility included recurrent GBM (any recurrence) with a maximum tumor size of < 70 mm. The SonoCloud-9 device (CarThera, Paris, France) was implanted during tumor debulking/resection surgery and replaced the bone flap, with the device targeting the tumor and surrounding peritumoral brain. The device was activated every four weeks for a duration of 270 seconds, concomitantly with IV DEFINITY microbubbles (10 ml/kg), to disrupt the BBB prior to administration of carboplatin (AUC 4-6). MRI was performed to verify safety and evaluate efficacy of BBB disruption with Gd enhancement. ,Results:, No DLTs were observed. The overall tolerance of the SonoCloud-9 implant was good, with two transient, manageable grade 3 wound infections and one grade 1 acquired meningocele event considered as probably related to the overall procedure. The most frequent neurologic adverse events were grade 1 blurred vision (5%) and dizziness (5%). ,Conclusions:, Significant Gd enhancement was observed after more than 90% of sonication sessions, suggesting effective BBB disruption and carboplatin enhancement.

  ,Background:, Fear of cancer recurrence (FCR) in cancer survivors is an understudied phenomenon estimated to one-third to over half of all cancer survivors. FCR has been shown to contribute to treatment noncompliance and portend a decrease in overall survival (OS). The purpose of this study was to examine factors associated with needs related to FCR among patients seen at a solid tumor survivorship clinic at a National Cancer Institute designated center. ,Methods:, Data collected as part of a patients’ needs assessment that is administered to patients (n = 657) with solid tumors such as breast, genitourinary, gastrointestinal malignancies at their initial clinic visit were analyzed. Correlations between responses were calculated and univariable and multivariable logistic regression was used to identify predictors of met or unmet needs related to FCR. ,Results:, There were a total of 657 patients included 442 (67.3%) female and 215 (32.7%) male. The majority of patients (84.5%) were white (n = 555), followed by 9.74% black (n = 64), the remaining patients identified as ‘other’ or Asian. The patients median age was 67 years, median age of diagnosis 55 years, and median years since diagnosis 10 years. 613 patients had recorded distress scores ranging from 0 (n = 214), 1-4 (n = 255), 5-7 (n = 106), or 8-10 (n = 38). Of 647 patients, 241 (37.2%) reported FCR was not a need and 386 (59.7%) reported FCR was a met need. According to univariate logistic regression gender had no impact on FCR (p = 0.8427) nor did years since diagnosis (p = 0.1014). Results of multivariable regression indicate the odds ratio of reporting FCR as an unmet need (vs not a need) decreases by 6% (p = 0.0023) for every year increase in age. For each unit increase in distress score the odds ratio of reporting FCR as an unmet need is increased by 32% (p = 0.0007). ,Conclusions:, Our data suggests that patients reporting higher distress scores are more likely to report FCR as an unmet need. Therefore, survivors with high distress scores reported in clinic visits should be evaluated for FCR. FCR reported as an unmet in our study is significantly less. Further stratification of FCR can be helpful for providers caring for survivors to identify and address FCR more effectively in clinical care. Further study is needed to learn how survivors have come to identify the need as being met.","Jacob J.

  ,Background:, The development of non-invasive biomarkers has the potential to revolutionize clinical care for colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. The presence of bacteria in CRC tumor biopsies has been shown to contribute to CRC development. In a previous study, our group showed some intra-tumor microbes in CRC tumor biopsies correlated with overall survival in CRC patients. However, the correlations between microbes in tumor vs blood, and between non-invasive serum marker carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and microbes are unknown. We hypothesize that tumor microbes will also be found in blood, and that CEA will correlate with certain microbes. ,Methods:, We obtained RNA-seq data from CRC tumor biopsies from patients treated at The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center as part of the Oncology Research Information Exchange Network (ORIEN). Reads were aligned to human and exogenous genomes using TopHat2 and Kraken2/Bracken, respectively. RNA-seq from CRC tumor biopsies as well as peripheral blood at the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) consortium were processed by the same method. ,Results:, The analyzed ORIEN cohort included 93 CRC patients with an age range from 30-83 years, 60.2% male, 87.1% adenocarcinoma, and 47.3% with metastatic CRC. The TGCA cohort included 495 CRC patients with an age range from 31-90 years, 53.3% male, 85.1% adenocarcinoma, and 15.5% with metastatic CRC. Over fifteen exogenous phyla (including bacteria, viruses, fungi) were observed in both ORIEN and TCGA cohorts. Several of the samples were dominated by viral sequences while others by bacteria, suggesting considerable tumor microbiome heterogeneity. Evaluation of the fraction of microbes in tumor and blood showed that nearly all the microbes found in blood (97.6%) were also observable in tumor in the TCGA cohort. Microbial abundances of various taxa, including ,Fusobacterium,, significantly correlated between blood and tumor. Several bacteria including members of the genera ,Bacillus, and ,Staphylococcus, were positively associated with tumor stage (metastatic vs non-metastatic), but microbial relative abundances were not correlated with the location of tumor in colon (right, left, transverse colon). Certain microbial species from the ORIEN cohort were found to positively correlate with CEA, (including from the genera ,Fusobacterium, Lactobacillus, Pseudomonas, Vibrio, Clostridium), and these associations remained when adjusted for alcohol and smoking by multivariate analysis. ,Conclusions:, Nearly all the microbes found in blood were found in tumor and abundances of various taxa were significantly correlated, suggesting that blood-based cancer microbiome analysis has great potential. Serum CEA has a low diagnostic ability when used alone, but combining this with blood microbiome could improve diagnostic/prognostic utility as a non-invasive biomarker.","Pannaga G.

  ,Background:, Subjective cognitive impairment (SCI) is one of the most commonly occurring symptoms in breast cancer patients. Chemotherapy (CTX) may be an important contributing factor to SCI, yet its association with SCI has been inconclusive. The meta-analysis with longitudinal data can provide more conclusive evidence as to the impact of CTX on SCI. This meta-analysis aimed to (a) determine whether CTX is associated with time-dependent SCI outcomes in breast cancer patients with pooled longitudinal data and (b) identify at the time point with the highest impact of CTX on SCI. ,Methods:, Data were collected from Pubmed, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsychInfo, and the Cochrane library in November 2020. Effect sizes (Hedges’ g) were calculated for the mean differences of the SCI level between the CTX treated patients and controls. Data were analyzed by and across clinical time periods; during CTX, within 1-month-post CTX, within 1-year-post CTX, and 1-year or longer post-CTX. ,Results:, The longitudinal data were pooled with 9 data sets from 13 studies, including 857 patients treated by CTX, 410 patients not treated by CTX, and 517 healthy subjects. At baseline, CTX patients showed significantly better SCI compared to the non-CTX patient controls (ES=0.17, p=.031) and did not differ from healthy controls (ES = -0.04, ,p, = .77). The CTX-treated patients had significantly worse SCI compared to both type of controls after initiating CTX. The effect sizes for the group differences were larger for the group comparison with healthy controls than the non-CTX control (- 0.16 for the comparison with non-CTX control, -0.51 for comparison with the healthy control). The largest time effect was found at the time point of within 1-month-post CTX in comparison with the healthy control (- 0.81). ,Conclusions:, Our analysis indicated the association of CTX with SCI. Yet, more studies are needed to confirm the impact of CTX as (a) the effect size for the comparison with non-CTX control is very small and (b) limited data on the comparison with controls at the time point during active CTX and immediately after CTX. ,The group differences in subjective cognitive impairment (N=9 data sets from 13 studies)","Heeju Kim, Sun-Ok Jung, Esther Kim, Ivo Abraham","The Catholic University of Korea, College of Nursing, Seoul, South Korea, Ewha Womans University, Seoul, South Korea, SF State University School of Nursing, San Francisco, CA, University of Arizona College of Pharmacy, Tucson, AZ","J Clin Oncol 39, 2021 (suppl 15; abstr e24050)",,2021 ASCO Annual Meeting,,"by the Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology",Publication Only: Symptoms and Survivorship,,Symptoms and Survivorship,The impact of chemotherapy on subjective cognitive complaints in breast cancer: Evidence from pooled analyses with longitudinal studies.,Symptoms and Survivorship

  ,Background:, The MORPHEUS platform consists of multiple, global, open-label, randomized Phase Ib/II trials designed to identify early efficacy and safety signals of treatment (tx) combinations across cancers. Here, atezo (anti-PD-L1) was tested with Imprime and bev (anti-VEGF) for MSS mCRC, a poorly immunogenic cancer generally resistant to checkpoint inhibitors. Imprime acts as a pathogen-associated molecular pattern that, when bound to anti-β glucan antibodies (ABA), activates the innate immune system with the potential to 1) promote priming and expansion of tumor-specific T cells, 2) promote M2-M1 macrophage polarization and 3) enhance the immunomodulatory effects of atezo and bev. Therefore, we hypothesized that atezo + Imprime + bev would induce an antitumor response beyond that of rego, a standard-of-care multikinase inhibitor, in patients (pts) with MSS mCRC. ,Methods:, Pts with MSS mCRC unselected for the Imprime-specific biomarker (ABA) and refractory to 1-2 prior lines of standard therapy received atezo (1200 mg IV every 3 weeks [q3w]) + Imprime (4 mg/kg IV on Days 1, 8, 15) + bev (7.5 mg/kg IV q3w) or control tx with rego (160 mg orally days 1-21; dose escalation to 160 mg during Cycle 1 allowed per institutional guidelines). The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR; investigator-assessed RECIST 1.1); secondary endpoints included disease control rate (DCR; response or stable disease ≥ 12 weeks), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and safety. ,Results:, Pts were followed-up for ≥18 wk. 15 pts received atezo + Imprime + bev and 13 received rego. Grade (Gr) 3/4 tx-related adverse events (TRAEs) were seen in 13% of atezo + Imprime + bev and 62% of rego pts. No Gr 5 AEs occurred in atezo + Imprime + bev pts and 1 (8%) was reported in a rego pt. One pt in each arm (7% vs 8%, respectively) withdrew from tx due to a TRAE. No radiological responses were seen in either arm. Five pts (33%) receiving atezo + Imprime + bev and 8 (62%) receiving rego had stable disease as best response. DCR was 13% with atezo + Imprime + bev and 23% with rego. Median PFS was 1.5 mo (95% CI: 1.4, 2.8) and 2.8 mo (95% CI: 1.6, 3.1), and median OS was 5.7 mo (95% CI: 4.4, 10.5) and 10.2 mo (95% CI: 4.8, NE) with atezo + Imprime + bev and rego, respectively. There was no apparent correlation between baseline PD-L1 expression or CD8+ lymphocyte tumor infiltration and clinical benefit. Further, the systemic exposure of atezo, Imprime and bev and immunogenicity of atezo and bev are in line with previous clinical experience. Additional biomarker, pharmacokinetics and anti-drug antibody data will be shown. ,Conclusions:, Atezo + Imprime + bev was well tolerated; toxicities were consistent with the safety profiles of the individual agents. No efficacy signal was identified with atezo + Imprime + bev in pts with MSS refractory mCRC. Clinical trial information: ,NCT03555149","Marwan Fakih, James M.

  ,Background:, Febrile neutropenia is a serious complication of chemotherapy leading to hospitalization in cancer patients. According to a practice guidelines published by ASCO (American Society of clinical Oncology) and IDSA (Infectious Diseases Society of American) in 2018, patients meeting the criteria for low-risk neutropenia according to the MASCC score (Multinational Association for Supportive Care in Cancer Score) could be treated as outpatient and thus avoid hospitalization. The objective of the study was to assess the number and proportion of patients who were hospitalized for febrile neutropenia in university hospital that would have met the low risk criteria of febrile neutropenia. We also wanted to know if these patients had experienced a favorable outcome during hospitalization. ,Methods:, We performed a retrospective study including all patients admitted for febrile neutropenia in 3 hospitals in Quebec City during the period from January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2019. We excluded patients with leukemia, as well as stem cell transplant patients. The chart review retrospectively established the MASCC score for each patient. We also established according to predefined criteria whether the clinical course was favorable or unfavorable. ,Results:, A total of 177 hospitalizations met our inclusion criteria. We found that 101/177 (57.1%) of hospitalized patients met the criteria for low-risk neutropenia according to the MASCC score (score of 21 and above). Of this number 74/177 (41.8%) presented all the criteria suggested for receiving outpatient treatment. In these patients 70/177 (39.5%) presented a favorable evolution during hospitalization and thus 4/177 (2.3%) presented an unfavorable evolution. Among these, 2 patients presented with infections considered major (2 bacteremia), 1 patient developed acute renal failure, and 1 other patient developed delirium. There was no death or admission to the intensive care unit in these 4 patients. ,Conclusions:, According to this retrospective study, about 40% of patients admitted for febrile neutropenia filled the criteria of low risk febrile neutropenia and could be treated as outpatient. Given this represents a significant proportion of patients, a protocol for systematic follow-up of outpatient treatment with low-risk febrile neutropenia should be put in place.","Tommy Jean, Julie Lemieux, Geneviève Soucy, Francis Caron, Dominique Leblanc","Enfant-Jésus' Hospital, Québec, QC, Canada, CHU de Québec-Université Laval, Québec, QC, Canada, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Québec, Quebec City, QC, Canada, Centre hospitalier universitaire de Québec, Québec, QC, Canada","J Clin Oncol 39, 2021 (suppl 15; abstr e18762)",,2021 ASCO Annual Meeting,,None,Publication Only: Health Services Research and Quality Improvement,,Health Services Research and Quality Improvement,Retrospective study on the management of patients admitted for febrile neutropenia and considered to be at low risk at the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Québec.,Health Services Research and Quality Improvement

  ,Background:, Multiple myeloma (MM) remains incurable despite advances in medical treatment that have improved survival. Even with these improvements, most patients with MM eventually progress through standard drug classes of proteasome inhibitors (PIs), immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs), anti-CD38 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), and others. There are currently no prospective data on real-world standard-of-care (SOC) in patients who progress after PIs, IMiDs, and anti-CD38 mAbs. Here, we present interim results from LocoMMotion (NCT04035226), the first prospective efficacy and safety study of real-life SOC in patients with RRMM. ,Methods:, Eligible patients (aged ≥18 years [y]) with a diagnosis of MM were enrolled between August 2019 and October 2020 from 75 sites across 9 European countries and the US. Patients were included if they received ≥3 prior lines of therapy or were double-refractory to a PI and IMiD, had measurable disease at screening, received at least a PI, an IMiD, and anti-CD38 mAb with documented progressive disease since their last line of therapy, and had an ECOG PS score of 0 or 1. Responses were assessed per International Myeloma Working Group response criteria. A Response Review Committee assessed the overall response rate (ORR, primary objective) of real-life current SOC. Secondary objectives of the study included additional efficacy and safety evaluation of real-life SOC. ,Results:, The data cut-off was November 4, 2020 for the first interim analysis of 225 patients with a median follow-up of 3.7 months (range: 0–12.7), 22 (9.8%) patients were from the US and 203 (90.2%) were from Europe. Median age was 68 y (range: 41–89), 124 (55.1%) were male, 162 (72.0%) had a baseline ECOG PS score of 1, and median time since initial MM diagnosis was 6.0 y (range: 0.3–22.8). Patients had received a median of 4.0 (range: 2–13) prior lines of therapy; all patients were triple-class exposed, 166 (73.8%) were triple-class refractory, and 208 (92.4%) were refractory to last line of therapy. The ORR with real-life SOC salvage therapy was 20.1% (95% CI: 15.0–26.0) in the response-evaluable population (n = 219). Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were reported in 148 (65.8%) patients, 95 (42.2%) were grade ≥3. The most common grade ≥3 TEAEs were anemia, thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia. Fifteen deaths (6.7%) occurred due to TEAEs during the study. Treatment is ongoing in 121 (53.8%) patients. ,Conclusions:, The interim results of this first, prospective study of real-life SOC treatment in heavily pretreated, triple-class exposed patients with RRMM demonstrate that patients continue to progress after multiple lines of therapy and have poor outcomes. Therefore, there is a need for new treatments with novel mechanisms of action for this patient population.

  ,Background:, The aim of the study was to investigate the predictive value of neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio(NLR) and platelet count(PLT) in the prediction of chemotherapy response and prognosis in patients with advanced gastric cancer. ,Methods:, In this retrospective study, a total of 260 advanced gastric cancer patients were analyzed and the correlation between NLR, PLT and overall survival (OS) were investigated. The receiver operating curve (ROC) was drawn to determine the optimal critical value of NLR. These cases were included and separated into different groups according to the median values of NLR or PLT. ,Results:, Low baseline NLR level correlated with improved clinicopathological characteristics, including organ-free metastasis, Borramn type I and II, tubular adenocarcinoma and papillary carcinoma. Low baseline PLT level also associated with Borramn classification. Alterations in the NLR and PLT levels were associated with therapeutic efficacy and prognosis. The patients who remained in or switched to the low NLR level had an improved objective response rate(ORR), disease control rate(DCR) and survival ratios. The patients who remained in or switched to the low PLT level had an improved DCR. Univariate analyses showed that pathological type, Borramn typing, changes of NLR, and efficacy of chemotherapy were significant predictors of OS. Multivariate analyses showed that pathological type and efficacy evaluation were independent prognostic factor. ,Conclusions:, This study demonstrated that the changes of NLR and PLT following chemotherapy can predict the chemotherapy results in patients with advanced gastric cancer. But, baseline NLR and PLT level haven’t prognostic value in patients with advanced gastric cancer. However, pathological types and the results of the first therapeutic evaluation could have prognostic value in patients with advanced gastric cancer.","Yibing Liu, Qingju Meng, Zhiguo Zhou, Li Jing","Fourth Hospital of Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, China, Department of Orthopedics, The First Hospital, Xingtai, China, 4th Hospital of Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, China","J Clin Oncol 39, 2021 (suppl 15; abstr e16030)",,2021 ASCO Annual Meeting,,None,"Publication Only: Gastrointestinal Cancer—Gastroesophageal, Pancreatic, and Hepatobiliary",,"Gastrointestinal Cancer—Gastroesophageal, Pancreatic, and Hepatobiliary",Changes in neutrophil /lymphocyte ratio and platelet count after chemotherapy correlate with cheomtherapy response and predicition of prognosis in patients with advanced gastric cancer.,"Gastrointestinal Cancer—Gastroesophageal, Pancreatic, and Hepatobiliary"

  ,Background:, In 2020, colorectal cancer (CRC) ranks second in incidence and third in mortality among all types of cancers in China based on data from GLOBOCAN. Moreover, the rates of incidence and mortality have been continuously rising over the past several decades. In addition to conventional methods for detection and screening of CRC such as gFOBT, FIT, and colonoscopy, a stool-based methylation test of human ,SDC2, gene was recently approved by National Medical Product Association (NMPA) of China. We hereby report the performance of this newly approved test in a hospital-based cohort of more than 10,000 patients in the real world of daily clinical practice. ,Methods:, The methylation target, human ,SDC2, gene, was extracted from stool and purified via sequence-specific capture technology. The isolated DNA was further treated with bisulfite before it was subsequently amplified by quantitative methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (qMSP) to analyze the fecal level of ,SDC2, methylation. Subjects were further examined by colonoscopy or CT imaging. Pathological examination would also be performed in cases deemed necessary. ,Results:, A total of 11,284 individuals were tested using the novel ,SDC2, methylation test. Among them, 858 and 10,426 were tested positive and negative, respectively. Follow-up visits, treatment, and medical information were complete for 429 positive and 780 negative patients who were included in this final analysis. Positive predictive value (PPV) of CRC and adenomas was 36.4% (156/429) and 24.5% (105/429), respectively. Stratified analysis implies that ,SDC2, methylation level in CRC was significantly higher than those in adenoma and normal groups. In CRC, no significant correlation was observed between ,SDC2, methylation and clinicopathological features including gender and grade of dysplasia. In < 65 and ≥ 65 age groups, the CRC detection rate in males was higher than that in females―almost two times higher in ≥ 65 age group. ,Conclusions:, The stool-based ,SDC2, methylation test demonstrated high accuracy in the detection of CRC and advanced adenomas. It is a sensitive and valid modality expected to play a significant role to aid diagnosis and screening of CRC and precancerous lesions in order to reduce the morbidity and mortality of this malignant disease.","Yanmei Liu, Weiguo Yin, Lei Peng, Xianshu Wang, Hongzhi Zou, Haibo Zhou","The Qingyuan People's Hospital, Qingyuan, China, Creative Biosciences (Guangzhou) Co., Ltd., Guangzhou, China, Creative Biosciences (Guangzhou) Co., Ltd, Guangzhou, China","J Clin Oncol 39, 2021 (suppl 15; abstr 3525)",,2021 ASCO Annual Meeting,Online Only,None,Gastrointestinal Cancer—Colorectal and Anal,Poster Session,Gastrointestinal Cancer—Colorectal and Anal,Clinical utility of stool-based ,Gastrointestinal Cancer—Colorectal and Anal

  ,Background:, Colorectal cancer is one of the most common and lethal types of cancer in the world. However, the molecular mechanism of colorectal cancer and predicting biomarkers for prognosis are still not fully understood. ,Methods:, Here, we investigated a cohort study to explore the genetic alteration of Chinese colorectal cancer patients. Primary tumors and metastatic tumors were collected and performed with whole exome sequencing. Distinct therapeutic effects of patients were recorded and analyzed. Overall survival of patients was also collected. ,Results:, 57 patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) were enrolled in this study. The mutation landscape of primary tumors showed that the TOP 10 most frequently mutated genes were, APC,, ,TP53,, ,KRAS,, ,FRG1,, ,SOX9,, ,PIK3CA,, ,MUC12,, ,SMAD4,, ,MUC4,, and ,DNAH9,. The main genetic mutation type was missense. Both primary tumors and metastatic tumors shared the feature of mutated ,TP53,, ,APC,, and ,KRAS,. However, the primary tumors harbored higher mutated ,FMN2,, ,PLXNB2,, ,DSCAM,, ,SSPO,, and ,PCDHA13,, while the metastatic tumors harbored ,RYR2,, ,RAB15,, ,WNK1,, ,MUC16,, and ,HERC2,. Moreover, ,APC, mutation showed a better overall survival (p = 0.029). Co-mutation of ,APC, and ,FRG1, also presented a better overall survival than one-mutation or none-mutation types (p = 0.029). In contrast, ,ARID3A, mutation (p < 0.001), ,NUDT6, mutation (p < 0.0099), ,ZNF717, mutation (p = 7e-04). Curative surgery showed better overall survival than palliative surgery (p = 0.042). However, EBV infection showed no significant relation to overall survival (p = 0.89). In addition, patients harboring ,FRG1, or ,CEL, mutation were more sensitive to chemotherapy (p = 0.01 and p = 0.02 respectively), while TMB was not significantly related to the effects of chemotherapy. Interestingly, somatic mutations, including ,NEURL4,, ,DLGAP5,, ,EML1,, ,MBD3L1,, ,SETBP1,, ,TMC4,, ,YTHDC1,, ,PLXNB2,, ,ARHGAP8,, and ,CHD2, were found to be significantly related to patients with family histories (p < 0.05). ,Conclusions:, In this study, we investigated the mutation landscape of primary tumors and metastatic tumors of Chinese colorectal cancer patients. Moreover, the associations between prognosis and different factors, including genetic mutations, surgery strategies, TMB, EBV, and family histories were explored, which may help shed light on better clinical treatment for colorectal cancer in the future.","Ye Xu, Tianhao Mu","Shanghai Cancer Hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai, China, HaploX Biotechnology, Shenzhen, China","J Clin Oncol 39, 2021 (suppl 15; abstr e15544)",,2021 ASCO Annual Meeting,,None,Publication Only: Gastrointestinal Cancer—Colorectal and Anal,,Gastrointestinal Cancer—Colorectal and Anal,A cohort study on the molecular mechanism of distinct therapeutic effects and prognosis in Chinese colorectal cancer patients who underwent neoadjuvant or surgical therapies.,Gastrointestinal Cancer—Colorectal and Anal

  ,Background:, Among patients with hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative breast cancer, several prospective studies investigated various gene expression assays, such as 21-gene recurrence score (21 RS) and 70-gene signature (70 GS), to identify a subgroup of patients with pathologic complete response (pCR) from neoadjuvant chemotherapy. However, in the absence of large prospective trials to validate such findings, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guideline does not recommend the routine adoption of such assays in the setting of neoadjuvant therapies. To address this knowledge gap, we performed an observational cohort study to compare pCR and survival outcomes based on these assays. ,Methods:, The National Cancer Database (NCDB) was queried for female patients diagnosed between 2010 and 2017 with stage I-III breast cancer who underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy and either 70 GS or 21 RS. Logistic multivariable analysis (MVA) was performed to identify variables associated with pCR. Cox MVA was performed to evaluate overall survival (OS). Subgroup analyses were performed among patients with favorable hormone receptor status (hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative) and with RS ≥26 instead of RS ≥31. ,Results:, A total of 3,009 patients met our inclusion criteria, with 2,075 (n = 1,287 for RS < 31, n = 788 for RS ≥31) and 934 (n = 175 for low risk, n = 759 for high risk) patients who underwent 21 RS and 70 GS, respectively. The median follow up was 48.0 months (interquartile range 32.2-66.7). On logistic MVA for all patients, those with a high risk from 70 GS or with RS ≥31 were more likely to have pCR. When compared to RS ≥31, a high risk from 70 GS was not associated with pCR. However, among those with favorable hormone receptor status, similar findings were noted, except that those with a high risk group from 70 GS were less likely to have pCR compared to those with RS ≥31. On Cox MVA for all patients, pCR was associated with improved OS. While RS ≥31 was associated with worse mortality, a high risk from 70 GS was not. No interaction was observed between pCR and risk groups for OS in both groups (interaction p = 0.23 for 70 GS, p = 0.66 for 21 RS). When analyses were repeated using a high risk group from 21 RS defined as RS ≥26, similar findings were noted, except that having favorable hormone receptor status and RS ≥26 was not associated with pCR when compared to the high risk from 70 GS. ,Conclusions:, To our knowledge, this is the largest study using a nationwide oncology database suggesting that high recurrence risk groups in both assays were associated with pCR and that pCR was associated with improved survival. For those with favorable hormone receptor status, RS ≥31 may be a more selective prognostic marker. Further studies would be warranted to investigate the role of gene expression assays in the setting of neoadjuvant chemotherapy.","Sung Jun Ma, Brian Yu, Lucas M Serra, Austin Bartl, Mark Farrugia, Austin Iovoli, Oluwadamilola Temilade Oladeru, Joseph Miccio, Saif Aljabab, Simon Fung-Kee-Fung, Daphne A.
